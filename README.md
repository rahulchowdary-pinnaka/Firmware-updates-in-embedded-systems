# Embedded systems research project at TU Chemnitz

The idea of this research project is to survey different possible methologies to update the firmware of an embedded system. Afterwards selecte one possible method and implement the same in the given embedded system (DWM1001). Please have a look at the presentation to get the conceptual idea of this project work.
